Code-defined website for Aaban Classic Building Cleaning L.L.C.:

- The booking-first page is the homepage itself (served at /). The previous
  homepage is parked, unpublished, at /home-classic — recoverable, never
  deleted. Old /home-v2 links 301-redirect to /.
- Full page set: /services overview, four service detail pages with
  rate-card pricing, /about (facts from the licence and the contract master
  sheet), /faq — plus the native /contactus form kept as the contact page.
- Site-wide branded footer (replaces website.footer_custom) with licence,
  TRN, service links and the corrected contact details (800 AABAN, both
  mobiles, infoaabanservices@gmail.com — no landline), and a fixed mobile
  action bar (Book / WhatsApp / Call) on every page.
- One SCSS asset carries the whole look (brand ink #17171a, orange #ef7d25),
  including navbar styling and the "Book a visit" menu entry as a button.
- The install hook / migration makes each website's main menu exactly:
  Home, Services (full-width mega menu: service tiles with prices, trust
  chips, AMC rail with contact CTA), About us, FAQ, Contact, Book a visit.
  Legacy internal menu items are removed (external links are kept) and
  all legacy pages are unpublished — recoverable from the page manager,
  never deleted.
